The objective of the game is to defend yourself and your house from the zombies.
If a zombie reaches you, you die and the game is over. If 15 zombies reach your
house, the game is over. As you progress through the game, the game becomes more
difficult and the zombies run faster. Some zombies are able to dodge bullets
and some zombies require more than 1 bullet to die. To learn the controls or
to customize them, check the 'Controls' section in the 'Settings' menu.
The cheat button is 'C', the pause button is 'P' and the boss key is 'Esc'.
